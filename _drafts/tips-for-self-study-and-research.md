title: "Tips for self-study and independent research"
---
**TODOs:**
* **rename gagent -> chat_agent, make sure it builds, update readme, publish the repo.**
* **publish AgentOS? (or remove link to it under "Build small projects")**

I've spent about a year ramping up on reinforcement learning (RL) and related research topics. Not too long ago, I spent six years getting my PhD at Berkeley. My current research is less focused on publishing and more independent than my PhD work, and I find that independence comes with unique challenges and rewards. So, I want to share some tips for effective self-study and independent research. (If you're interested in what I'm working on, read [my research goals and what I've been learning](research-goals.html).) 

* **Write down your goals.** Do you want to publish a paper? Contribute to an open source project? Gain experience for a career change? Do you simply enjoy learning? You can have more than one goal, but sort them and _pick one as your primary._
* **Mix learning and practicing.** I learn by reading, watching videos, taking online classes, and participating in study groups. I practice by coding. A 1:1 ratio works well for me. I usually spend days or weeks in one mode before flipping to the other.
* **Regularly read classic papers.** Get to know the history of the field and the key figures. Often what they've done is worth trying yourself, or will influence your direction.
* **Start or join a reading group.** This helps with motivation and learning. Don't overdo it, start with one paper or textbook chapter per month, adjust later if necessary. Take notes each time; consider posting them online.
* **Write down your research plan.** I keep mine in a google doc. I re-read and update it frequently. It starts high level and aspirational and gets more detailed. Here are some sections my plan contains:
    * One sentence summary of research.
    * Milestones - a one line objective for each of: 3mo / 6mo / 1yr / 2yr. I review and revise this section every three months.
    * Draft abstract + intro of a hypothetical research paper (dissertation?) that I hope to some day write if my research works out.
    * Learning plan / courses to take.
    * Reading list & related work.
    * FAQ. Brainstorm questions that you expect to encounter, both from others and yourself. Since I shifted from lots of structure in my previous role to little structure in my current role, my FAQ includes questions like _"why am i doing this?"_ and _"what possible challenges do I expect?"_
* **Conduct self-performance reviews.** One of the toughest things about research is the lack of structure. I force structure on myself: every three months I write down where I can improve the most, and what I'm most proud of. In fact, this blog post is part of my 1yr performance review.
* **Keep a research journal.** I keep my journal at the end of my research plan, and this blog is an experiment in shifting some of my journaling to be public.
* **Don't worry about novelty.** It is valuable to implement well known algorithms yourself. Remember to cite the author if you publish your code or any writeups.
* **Build small projects.** Apply what you're learning. Spend hours (not days) making a 1-2 page design doc including a 1 sentence summary of the project, 1-3 paragraphs of overview, and a bullet list of the initial features. Spend weeks (not months) building the first prototype of a project. Some friends and I spent a couple months [implementing 2048 and a bunch of algos to play it](https://github.com/andyk/improved-funicular); it was motivating and we learned a lot. I also built a chat bot, a python library and CLI for implementing RL algorithms, and a handful of smaller projects.

**TODO ADD LINKS TO THESE PROJECTS HERE ^**

* **Write up your progress.** When you've accomplished a small project, take a few hours to write up your results and some reflections.
* **Teach what you learn.** Can be a short talk, or even better a short hands-on training tutorial.
* **Explore across disciplines.** Allow yourself to explore tangents (but time box them). Always try to synthesize what you're learning back into your research hypothesis. RL and neuroscience and behavioral psych.  The meta-point here might be something around re-evaluation and evolution of your goals as you make progress in your study.  
* **Contact people in the field** Be bold (but humble). Read their recent papers or books first. Approach them with a technical topic to discuss that overlaps with their research. Researchers are generally meritocratic, so they will give you time if you have ideas that are interesting to them. Expect to be rejected or ignored. Get an introduction if you can.
* **Find folks to collaborate with.**
    * Look where you work. For academics, this is straight-forward, e.g., PhD students have their advisors and other students. For others, there might already be reading groups or chat channels at your company you can join. If not, you have other options: attend meetups, post on mailing lists of popular open source projects, or go to a conference.
    * Once you find a collaborator, some of your solo activites can become group activities. I work closely with a friend [Nick Jalbert](https://nickjalbert.github.io/) that I met in grad school. We have weekly video chats and occasionally in-person mini-retreats. Here are examples of ways Nick and I collaborate:
        * Every few weeks, we read a paper and then meet to discuss it.
        * We built a short hands-on [Intro to RL tutorial](https://www.meetup.com/LA-Deep-RL/events/268096321/) for the LA Deep RL meetup group.
        * We are self-studying our way through [Gilbert Strang's online linear algebra course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011/).
        * We write code together. Sometimes we both work on our own separate implementation of an algorithm and then compare, sometimes we give each other code or design reviews, sometimes we pair program.
* **Spend time motivating yourself.** I once read that people overestimate how much progress they can make in a month and underestimate how much they can make in a year; this is my experience with self-study and independent research. Major research accomplishments tend to take years of work. Along the way, you should expect to ocassionally feel bored, distracted, hopeless, disillusioned, etc. I don't wait for these moments to arrive to manage them. Instead, I proactively set aside time for activities that inspire me. For me, this includes sci-fi (books, television, movies), YouTube videos, and passionate conversations with friends about RL and AI. And when a bad day comes along, I take a break from work, listen to music or go the gym, talk it out with Nick or my wife, or try jumping into a different project. All the while, I remain receptive and patient for my sense of drive to return. And it always does.
