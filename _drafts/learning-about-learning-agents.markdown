I've spent about a year thinking and learning about learning alrogithms with an emphasis on RL. I found that, while folks have been working on the topic for many years, from many different angles, much of the content is either more high-level or low-level than what I'm looking for.

Sometimes this has left me feeling overwhelmed and lost. If I could go back in time a year, here are some tips I'd give myself:

* Find excuses to write up and code up what you're doing as you go
* Mix learning and practicing. I learn by reading, watching videos, taking online classes, etc. I practice by coding. I've found about a 1:1 ratio works pretty well for me.
* Regularly carve out time to learn the history, reading classic papers, etc.
* Find folks to collaborate with
    * For academics this is relatively straight-forward (PhD students have their advisors, other professors, other students, etc.)
    * ...but we aren't all academics, so use other ways to find your learning buddies: attend meetups, post to slack channels and mailing lists of popular projects, go to conferences, etc.
    * I collaborate closely with [Nick Jalbert](https://nickjalbert.github.io/reading), mostly through weekly skype calls and ocassionaly in-person mini-retreats.
* Once you find a collaborator...
    * Start reading and discussing. Every few weeks, Nick and I pick a paper or textboko chapter, usually a classic or highly cited paper, read it, and meet to discuss.
    * Code on RL agents together. We do this in all sorts of ways, sometimes we are both working on our own seperate implementation of an algorithm that we're focused on, sometimes we give each other code or design reviews, sometimes we pair program.
    * Take an online class together. We are self-studying our way through [Gilbert Strang's online linear algebra course](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011/), etc.
    * Prepared a talk together. We I built an Intro to RL class for the [LA RL meetup](https://meetup.com/la-deep-rl)
