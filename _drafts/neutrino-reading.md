This week some friends and I read and discussed the article [Hidden Neutrino Particles May Be a Link to the Dark Sector](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/hidden-neutrino-particles-may-be-a-link-to-the-dark-sector/) (sorry it is behind a paywall) by William Charles Louis, Richard G. Van de Water, from the July 2020 edition of Scientific American. Here are my notes.

### Summary
* Neutrinos are elementary particles.
* They were thought to be massless for a long time.
* Now we know they have a tiny amount of mass.
* They have 3 flavors: electron, tau, muon.
* They switch betwen flavors as they move through space.
* They only interact via gravity and 1 of the 3 fundamental forces of the [Standard Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model): the weak force.

### Thoughts
* What else travels at the speed of light?
