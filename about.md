I'm Andy. I'm a co-founder of [Databricks](https://databricks.com/) and [Perplexity AI](https://perplexity.ai). I also advise and invest in startups coming out of the UC Berkeley Computer Science PhD program; related to that I co-teach [Research to Startup](https://startups.berkeley.edu) classes for CS PhDs.

I finished my PhD and Postdoc in Computer Science in the [AMPLab](http://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/about/) at UC Berkeley. My research and work is focused on data processing and machine learning systems like [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/), [MLflow](https://mlflow.org), and [Mesos](http://mesos.apache.org).

During grad school, I interned at Yahoo! with the Hadoop team, co-created Mesos, and interned at Google with the Borg team. At Databricks, I've contributed to Spark, led the creation of Spark MOOCs (a collaboration with UC Berkeley and EdX), built the training and professional services orgs, started the [Spark Summits](https://databricks.com/sparkaisummit), and was the first product manager of [MLflow](http://mlflow.org).
