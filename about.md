* I'm Andy Konwinski.
* I'm a co-founder of [Databricks](https://databricks.com/) and [Perplexity AI](https://perplexity.ai).
* I advise and invest in startups coming out of top CS departments.
* I teach a PhD seminar called [Research to Startups](https://startups.berkeley.edu) in the Berkeley CS dept.

Background:
* I got my PhD in Computer Science at UC Berkeley.
* My research is focused on AI/data/ML systems like [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/), [MLflow](https://mlflow.org), and [Mesos](http://mesos.apache.org).
* During grad school, I contributed to Hadoop, co-created Mesos, interned at Google with the Borg team, and was part of the team that created Spark.
* At Databricks, I was VP Product AI/MLI, created the [Data+AI Summit](https://www.databricks.com/dataaisummit), and built the professional services & training org from scratch to a 30 person team ($10M/yr budget).
