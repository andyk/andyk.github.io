<img src="/assets/img/headshot.jpeg" style="float:right; width:330px; padding-left:20px"/>I'm Andy Konwinski. I co-founded [Databricks](https://databricks.com/) and [Perplexity](https://perplexity.ai). I advise and invest in startups built by technical founders. I also teach a PhD seminar called [Research to Startups](https://startups.berkeley.edu) in the Berkeley CS dept. I hack on [researchy AI systems](https://github.com/andyk/headlong) for [fun](https://github.com/andyk/recursive_llm).

Background:
* I got my PhD in Computer Science at UC Berkeley.
* My research is focused on AI/data/ML systems like [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/), [MLflow](https://mlflow.org), and [Mesos](http://mesos.apache.org).
* During grad school, I contributed to Hadoop, co-created Mesos (NSDI Test of Time award 2021), worked at Google on the [Omega cluster scheduler](https://cs.brown.edu/people/malte/pub/papers/2013-eurosys-omega.pdf) (Eurosys Best Student Paper 2013 / Test of Time award 2023), and was part of the team that created Spark.
* At Databricks, I was VP Product AI/ML, created the [Data+AI Summit](https://www.databricks.com/dataaisummit), and built the Professional Services + Training orgs from scratch.
