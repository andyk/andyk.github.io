K Prize Round 1 is Officially Closed \- thank you\!   
<img style="padding:2px; float:right" src="/assets/img/kprize-dollars.gif" alt="" width="45%">

Well, that was fun. Submissions for the first phase of Konwinski Prize are now closed \- thanks to the 599 teams who entered what I’ll call “round 1” of K Prize. The competition was fierce, and this is not an easy benchmark. Congrats to those of you who made it to the Kaggle leaderboard. 

Now that the submission deadline has passed, we’ll begin collecting our test set to figure out real scores. We’ll announce a first batch of prize winners on June 11th, so stay tuned. No submissions will be allowed during the competition downtime. 

Rest assured, I still intend to give a million bucks to the first open source AI that breaks 90% on this benchmark. 

K Prize was meant to do three things:

* Measure how AI coders perform when they can’t cheat  
* Model a better way to benchmark (contamination free with a prize\!)  
* Move AI forward in the open

And we’re not done yet\! We’re already working on the next phase of K Prize, incorporating learnings from this time around.
